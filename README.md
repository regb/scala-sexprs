SCALA S-EXPRS
=============

Scala library to manipulate S-Expressions.

This is an implementation of a simple s-expressions syntax.
As there is no standard reference for the s-expression format,
that specific implementation is probably not going to be compatible
with other existing ones.

S-expressions provide a concise representation for data, and can replace XML in
many simple data serialization problems.
