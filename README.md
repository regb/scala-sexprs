SCALA S-EXPRS
=============

Scala library to manipulate S-Expressions.

This is an implementation of a simple s-expressions syntax.  As there is no
standard reference for the s-expression format, that specific implementation is
probably not going to be compatible with other existing ones. However, it
should work great as long as the usage remain local to your own software.

S-expressions provide a concise representation for data, and can replace XML in
many simple data serialization problems.
